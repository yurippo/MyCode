    num1 = 10

    #Numbers - math operations
    1 + 2 #addition
     
    2 â€“ 1 #subtraction
     
    4 / 2 #division
     
    4 * 2 #multiplication
     
    4 ** 2 #raising to a power
     
    5 % 2 #modulo (this means finding out the remainder after division of one number by another)
     
    #Numbers - float division vs. integer division (special case)
    3 / 2 #float division; result is 1 in Python 2 and 1.5 in Python 3
     
    3 // 2 #integer division; result is 1 in Python 2 and Python 3
     
    #Numbers - order of evaluation in math operations
    #Highest priority: raising to a power; Medium priority: division, multiplication and modulo; Low priority: addition and subtraction
    100 - 5 ** 2 / 5 * 2 #1st: 5 ** 2, second: / then *, third - ; result is 90.0
     
    #Numbers - conversion between numeric types
    int(1.5) #result is 1
     
    float(2) #result is 2.0
     
    #Numbers - useful functions
    abs(5) #the distance between the number in between parantheses and 0
     
    abs(-5) #returns the same result as abs(5)
     
    max(1, 2) #returns the largest number
     
    min(1, 2) #returns the smallest number
     
    pow(3, 2) #another way of raising to a power
