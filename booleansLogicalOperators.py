    #Booleans - logical operations
    (1 == 1) and (2 == 2) #result is True; AND means that both operands should be True in order to get the expression evaluated as True
     
    (1 == 1) or (2 == 2) #result is True; when using OR, it is enough if only one expression is True, in order to have True as the final result
     
    not(1 == 1) #result is False; using the NOT operator means denying an expression, in this case denying a True expression
     
    not(1 == 2) #result is True; using the NOT operator means denying an expression, in this case denying a False expression
     
    None, 0, 0.0, 0L, 0j, empty string, empty list, empty tuple, empty dictionary #these values always evaluate to False
     
    bool(None) #returns False; function that evaluates values and expressions
     
    bool(0) #returns False; function that evaluates values and expressions
     
    bool(2) #returns True; function that evaluates values and expressions
     
    bool("router") #returns True; function that evaluates values and expressions
