CLI
The Azure CLI includes the vm command to work with virtual machines in Azure. We can supply several subcommands to do specific tasks. The most common include:

Sub-command	Description
create	Create a new virtual machine
deallocate	Deallocate a virtual machine
delete	Delete a virtual machine
list	List the created virtual machines in your subscription
open-port	Open a specific network port for inbound traffic
restart	Restart a virtual machine
show	Get the details for a virtual machine
start	Start a stopped virtual machine
stop	Stop a running virtual machine
update	Update a property of a virtual machine

Let's start with the first one: az vm create. This command is used to create a virtual machine in a resource group. There are several parameters you can pass to configure all the aspects of the new VM. The four parameters that must be supplied are:

Parameter	Description
--resource-group	The resource group that will own the virtual machine, use learn-1a607cb6-ae2c-466b-b02a-d3941f4d1c84.
--name	The name of the virtual machine - must be unique within the resource group.
--image	The operating system image to use to create the VM.
--location	The region in which to place the VM. Typically, this would be close to the VM's consumer. In this exercise, choose a location nearby from the following list.
In addition, it's helpful to add the --verbose flag to see progress while the VM is being created.

Create a Linux virtual machine
Let's create a new Linux virtual machine. Execute the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create an Ubuntu VM in the "West US" location.

Azure CLI

az vm create \
  --resource-group learn-1a607cb6-ae2c-466b-b02a-d3941f4d1c84 \
  --location westus \
  --name SampleVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --verbose
  
 This command will create a new Ubuntu Linux virtual machine with the name SampleVM. Notice that the Azure CLI tool waits while the VM is being created. You can add the --no-wait option to tell the Azure CLI tool to return immediately and have Azure continue creating the VM in the background. This is useful if you're executing the command in a script.

We are specifying the administrator account name through the --admin-username flag to be azureuser. If you omit this, the az vm create command will use your current user name. Since the rules for account names are different for each OS, it's safer to specify a specific name.
