Azure PowerShell is a module that you add to PowerShell to let you connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell requires PowerShell to function.
PowerShell provides services like the shell window, command parsing, and so on. The Azure Az PowerShell module adds the Azure-specific commands.

For example, Azure PowerShell provides the New-AzVM command that creates a virtual machine for you inside your Azure subscription.
To use it, you would launch the PowerShell application and then issue a command like the following:

Azure PowerShell

New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "CrmTestingResourceGroup" `
    -Name "CrmUnitTests" `
    -Image "UbuntuLTS"
    ...
    
    
 Azure PowerShell is also available two ways: inside a browser via the Azure Cloud Shell or with a local install on Linux, Mac, or Windows.
 In both cases, you have two modes to choose from.
 You can use it in interactive mode, in which you manually issue one command at a time, or in scripting mode, where you execute a script that consists of multiple commands.
