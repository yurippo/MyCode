##This Powershell Script Automates the creation of 3 Linux
##VMS with the image UbuntuLTS

##1. Switch to your home folder in Cloud Shell.
#### cd $HOME\clouddrive
##2. Create a new text file named ConferenceDailyReset.ps1.
### touch "./ConferenceDailyReset.ps1"
##3.Open the integrated editor and select the ConferenceDailyReset.ps1 file.
##code "./ConferenceDailyReset.ps1"

##Tip - The integrated Cloud Shell also supports vim, nano, and emacs if you'd prefer to use one of those editors.

##4.Start by capturing the input parameter in a variable. Add the following line to your script:

param([string]$resourceGroup)

##Normally, you'd have to authenticate with Azure using your credentials using Connect-AzAccount
#and this could be done in the script.
## However, in Cloud Shell environment you will already be authenticated so this is unnecessary.

##Prompt for a username and password for the VM's admin account and capture the result in a variable:

$adminCredential = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the VM administrator."

##6.Create a loop that executes three times:
##7.In the loop body, create a name for each VM and store it in a variable and output it to the console:
##8.Next, create a VM using the $vmName variable:


For ($i = 1; $i -le 3; $i++) 
{

    $vmName = "ConferenceDemo" + $i
    Write-Host "Creating VM: " $vmName    
    New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $vmName -Credential $adminCredential -Image UbuntuLTS

}

##9.Save the file. You can use the "..." menu at the top right corner of the editor. There are also common accelerator keys for Save.
### Execute the script
##Close the editor through the "..."context menu.
##1.Execute the script.

##./ConferenceDailyReset.ps1 learn-2119d8f0-dcb3-4397-84be-9b8575ed9261

## The script will take several minutes to complete.
# When it is finished, verify that it ran successfully by
# looking at the resources you now have in your resource group:

##Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines

##You should see three VMs, each with a unique name.
##You wrote a script that automated the creation of three VMs
#in the resource group indicated by a script parameter. 
#The script is short and simple but automates a process 
#that would take a long time to complete manually with the portal.
