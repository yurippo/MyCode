Windows PowerShell is included with the Windows operating system;
however, we recommend installing PowerShell 7.0.6 LTS, PowerShell 7.1.3, or higher for use with Azure Az PowerShell.
You can check which version is installed by using the following steps:

In the System tray search box, type PowerShell. You may have multiple shortcut links:

PowerShell 7 (x64) - The 64-bit version. Generally, this is the shortcut you should choose.
Windows PowerShell - The 64-bit version included with Windows.
Windows PowerShell (x86) - A 32-bit version installed on 64-bit Windows.
Windows PowerShell ISE - The Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is used for writing scripts in Windows PowerShell.
Windows PowerShell ISE (x86) - A 32-bit version of the ISE on Windows.
Select the best match PowerShell icon.

Type the following command to determine the version of PowerShell installed.

PowerShell

$PSVersionTable.PSVersion


OR

PowerShell

If the major version number is lower than 7, follow the instructions to upgrade existing Windows PowerShell.
It is important to install the SDK to support .NET tools, as well.

PowerShell

dotnet tool install --global PowerShell

After the .NET tool has been installed, run the PowerShell version command again to verify your installation.

You will also need to set up your local machine(s) to support PowerShell.
In the next unit, we'll review commands you can add, including the Azure Az PowerShell module.
