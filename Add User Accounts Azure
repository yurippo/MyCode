Add user accounts
You can add individual user accounts through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

If you want to use the Azure CLI, run the following cmdlet:

Azure CLI

# create a new user
az ad user create

This command creates a new user by using the Azure CLI.

For Azure PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

PowerShell

# create a new user
New-AzureADUser

You can bulk create member users and guests accounts. The following example shows how to bulk invite guest users.

PowerShell

$invitations = import-csv c:\bulkinvite\invitations.csv

$messageInfo = New-Object Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.InvitedUserMessageInfo

$messageInfo.customizedMessageBody = "Hello. You are invited to the Contoso organization."

foreach ($email in $invitations)
   {New-AzureADMSInvitation `
      -InvitedUserEmailAddress $email.InvitedUserEmailAddress `
      -InvitedUserDisplayName $email.Name `
      -InviteRedirectUrl https://myapps.microsoft.com `
      -InvitedUserMessageInfo $messageInfo `
      -SendInvitationMessage $true
   }
   
   
   
   
   
You create the comma-separated values (CSV) file with the list of all the users you want to add. An invitation is sent to each user in that CSV file.



Delete user accounts
You can also delete user accounts through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. In PowerShell, run the cmdlet Remove-AzureADUser. In the Azure CLI, run the cmdlet az ad user delete.

When you delete a user, the account remains in a suspended state for 30 days. During that 30-day window, the user account can be restored.
