//So, how do you find the particular commands you need? One way is to use az find. 
//For example, if you want to find commands that might help you manage a storage blob, you can use the following find command:

az find blob



//If you already know the name of the command you want, the --help argument for that command will get you more detailed information on the command,
//and for a command group, a list of the available subcommands. For example, here's how you can get a list of the subgroups and commands for managing blob storage:

az storage blob --help
