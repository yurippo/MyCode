You can create a stored access policy with C# code by using the Azure portal or Azure CLI commands.

With C# .NET code

C#

BlobSignedIdentifier identifier = new BlobSignedIdentifier
{
    Id = "stored access policy identifier",
    AccessPolicy = new BlobAccessPolicy
    {
        ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
        Permissions = "rw"
    }
};

blobContainer.SetAccessPolicy(permissions: new BlobSignedIdentifier[] { identifier });


With the portal

In the portal, go to the storage account and then go to the blob storage container. On the left, select Access policy. To add a new stored access policy, select + Add policy.

You can then enter all the required parameters.


With Azure CLI commands

Azure CLI

az storage container policy create \
    --name <stored access policy identifier> \
    --container-name <container name> \
    --start <start time UTC datetime> \
    --expiry <expiry time UTC datetime> \
    --permissions <(a)dd, (c)reate, (d)elete, (l)ist, (r)ead, or (w)rite> \
    --account-key <storage account key> \
    --account-name <storage account name> \
    
 Create SAS tokens and associate them with stored access policies
Let's associate the stored access policy you created with any new SAS tokens you need. 
For your company's patient diagnostic image web app, update the existing code to add the previous code.
Then, in the method that creates the SAS token, you reference the new stored access policy.

All of your existing code that's needed to create the SAS token is:

C#

BlobSasBuilder sas = new BlobSasBuilder
{
    BlobContainerName = blob.BlobContainerName,
    BlobName = blob.Name,
    Resource = "b",
    ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(1)
};
// Allow read access
sas.SetPermissions(BlobSasPermissions.Read);


and it can be replaced by referencing your new access policy.


C#

// Create a user SAS that only allows reading for a minute
BlobSasBuilder sas = new BlobSasBuilder
{
    Identifier = "stored access policy identifier"
};


You can have up to five stored access policies for on a single blob container.
